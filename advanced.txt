Advanced 1 – Documentation + Homework
i18n + PrimeReact Theming (Store App)
IMPORTANT:

- You may submit the homework no later than Thursday, 25.12.25.
 Submissions after this date will NOT be checked.
 The earlier you submit, the better (more time for review and fixes).
- If you have questions while working:
 Bring them with you to class
 We will review everything together
Good luck and enjoy!
Homework Submission Rules (Read Carefully)
Pull Request Policy
 Every homework assignment from each new session must be submitted in a separate
Pull Request.
 PR name format (mandatory):
advanced-<number>/<topic>
Example:
advanced-1/i18n-reactprime
Submission Process
1. Create a new Pull Request for every new session’s homework.
2. We will review the PR and leave comments.
3. You must fix everything we commented — no exceptions.
4. After applying all requested fixes, you may merge the PR into main yourself.

1. Assumptions & Goal
This homework supports two starting paths:
 Path A (recommended): You already have a Vite store app with TanStack Query (products list + product
detail).
 Path B (Advanced-only students): You will build a minimal starter app first (Step 0B), then continue with
the Advanced tasks.
Goal of this homework:
 Add i18n using i18next + react-i18next (namespaces, pluralization, interpolation, and one <Trans />
example).
 Introduce PrimeReact as the UI system and render the products list using PrimeReact DataTable.
 Add a PrimeReact theme switcher with persistence (localStorage).
Important rule: Do not duplicate server state (do not store full product lists/details outside TanStack Query).
2. Step 0 - Prep (Choose A or B)
2.1 Path A - Continue from your existing app
 Pull the latest changes and make sure the app still runs.
 Verify the products list page works (TanStack Query).
 Verify the product detail page works (TanStack Query, query by id).
 Confirm your fake API base URL is still valid.
Deliverable: Add 1-2 sentences to README, e.g. "Starting Advanced 1 from commit <hash>. API used:
<name> (<base URL>)."
2.2 Path B - Advanced-only starter (if you missed previous lectures)
Build a minimal store app baseline before you start i18n/PrimeReact:
 Create a new Vite React + TypeScript app (fresh repo is OK).
 Install react-router-dom and add routes:
 /products - products list
 /products/:id - product detail
 Optional: redirect / -> /products
 Install TanStack Query and mount QueryClientProvider at the top of the app.
Pick one fake API (any one is fine):
 FakeStore API - base: https://fakestoreapi.com (endpoints: /products, /products/:id)
 Platzi Fake Store API - base: https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1 (endpoints: /products, /products/:id)
 Implement two queries with TanStack Query:
3
 Products list query used on /products
 Product detail query used on /products/:id
 Add minimal UI states (plain text is fine): loading, error, empty list.
 Make sure navigation between list and detail works.
Deliverable: README note (same as Path A) + screenshots of: products list page and product detail page
working.
3. Step 1 - i18n Setup (Namespaces + 2 languages)
3.1 Install + initialize
 Install: i18next and react-i18next.
 Initialize i18n once (for example in src/i18n.ts) and load it from your app entry.
3.2 Namespaces (required)
Create at least two namespaces:
 common - header, buttons, generic UI labels
 products - catalog/list/detail strings
3.3 Two languages (required)
Use English plus one additional locale. Recommended second locale: Hebrew (he) for RTL practice (optional).
Deliverables:
 README: which locales and namespaces you used.
 Screenshot: the same page shown in both languages.
4. Step 2 - Use i18n for real (required features)
Translate visible UI strings on:
 Header/navigation
 Products list page (loading, empty state, error state, search label/placeholder, etc.)
 Product detail page (loading, error, buttons/labels that exist in your UI)
Your translations must demonstrate:
 Interpolation: e.g. "Showing {{count}} products"
 Pluralization: e.g. "1 product" vs "2 products"
 One <Trans /> usage: embed formatting or a link inside a translation
Deliverable: In README or notes, list 3 example keys (one per requirement) and where they appear in the
UI.

5. Step 3 - Language Switcher + Persistence
 Add a language switcher in the header (buttons or dropdown).
 Switching language updates the UI immediately.
 Persist the selected language in localStorage and restore it on page reload.
 Default to English (en) when nothing is stored.
Deliverables:
 Two screenshots (or a short GIF): switch language + refresh and it stays.
 3-5 lines describing how you persist and restore the language (plain language, not code).
6. Step 4 - RTL Mode (only if your second language is RTL)
If you chose a right-to-left language (e.g., he/ar):
 When RTL language is active: set document.documentElement.dir = "rtl" and
document.documentElement.lang to the locale code.
 Fix at least 2 layout issues caused by RTL (alignment, spacing, icon placement, etc.).
If you did not choose an RTL language: add a one-line note in README that RTL was skipped.
Deliverables:
 Screenshot of RTL mode (if applicable).
 Two bullets: "RTL issue -> fix".
7. Step 5 - PrimeReact Setup + DataTable Conversion
7.1 Install PrimeReact
 Install PrimeReact and PrimeIcons.
 Ensure required CSS is included so PrimeReact components render correctly.
7.2 Convert products list page to PrimeReact DataTable
Replace the products list UI with PrimeReact DataTable driven directly from TanStack Query data.
DataTable must include these columns:
 Title
 Price
 Category
 Image (cell template)
 Action column: "View details" OR row-click navigation
Also implement at least 2 DataTable features:
 Sorting (e.g., price or title)
5
 Pagination OR filtering/search integration (basic is enough)
Deliverables:
 Screenshot of the DataTable with multiple rows visible.
 Short note: which 2 DataTable features you implemented.
8. Step 6 - PrimeReact Theme Switch + Persistence
 Add a theme switcher in the header.
 Provide at least 2 PrimeReact themes (for example: one light + one dark).
 Switching theme must visibly affect PrimeReact components (DataTable/buttons/inputs).
 Persist the selected theme in localStorage and restore it on reload.
Deliverables:
 Two screenshots: the same screen in Theme A and Theme B.
 README: localStorage key + default theme name.
Bonus Tasks (optional, pick 0-2)
 Bonus A: Locale-aware formatting for price using Intl.NumberFormat (price looks correct per locale).
 Bonus B: Translate query error/empty/loading UI text thoroughly (no raw English strings).
Deliverable: For any bonus: 1 screenshot or 3-5 lines describing what you added.
Submission
 Push your branch and open a PR (or submit repo link) as you usually do.
 README must include the Step 0 note plus the deliverables listed in each step.
 Attach screenshots/GIFs in README or in a /docs folder with links.
