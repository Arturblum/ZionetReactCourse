# ZionetReactCourse

This repo hosts a simple Vite + React + TypeScript app in `my-react-app`. The app is a contact form with an About page powered by React Router. It collects first/last name, email, and phone, shows saved contacts, and updates a badge count + document title as you add entries.

## Getting started
1) `cd my-react-app`
2) Install deps: `npm install`
3) Start dev server: `npm run dev` (opens at http://localhost:5173)
4) Build for production: `npm run build`
5) Preview production build: `npm run preview`

## Notes
- Routes: `/` for the contact form, `/about` for the static page.
- Tooling: Vite, TypeScript, React Router, and ESLint with React hooks/refresh rules.
