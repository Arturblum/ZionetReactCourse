# Contact Info (React + Vite + TypeScript)

Simple demo with a contact form and a secondary About page, using React Router. The form collects first/last name, email, and phone; saved contacts render in a list and update the badge count and document title.

## Getting started
1) Install deps: `npm install`
2) Start dev server: `npm run dev` (visit http://localhost:5173)
3) Build for production: `npm run build`
4) Preview the production build: `npm run preview`

## Notes
- Routing: Home (`/`) hosts the contact form; `/about` is a static page.
- Tooling: TypeScript, Vite, ESLint (React hooks/refresh), and React Router.
