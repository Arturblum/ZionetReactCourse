Pre-Lecture Preparation (Required)
Before attending this lecture, you are expected to independently explore the different types of 
frontend testing.
You do not need to master them — only to arrive with basic familiarity.
Focus on:
 Unit testing
 Component testing
 Integration testing
 End-to-End (E2E) testing
For each type, try to understand:
 What is being tested
 At what level it runs (function, component, full app)
 One common tool used for it
 One advantage and one limitation
You are not expected to write code at this stage.
The purpose is to ensure that during the lecture:
 Concepts will sound familiar
 Comparisons will make sense
 You can ask better questions
